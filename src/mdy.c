   NAME julian_from_mdy

   DESCRIPTION  Convert to ``julian'' days from month/day/year, where 
   the julian day number is the number of days since 1/1/1960.

   ARGUMENTS
      IARG  td_input  struct containing the month, day, and year
      OARG  julian  the calculated day number 

   RETURN Returns 1/0 for success/failure.  The routine fails if the input 
   arguments do not correspond to a real date or if the pointer for the 
   return value is NULL.

   ALGORITHM This is a C function that calculates the day number given a
   month, day, and year.  The day number corresponds to the number of
   calendar days since January 1, 1960 (which is defined to be day 0).
   The calendar follows the conventions of the British Empire, which 
   changed from Julian to Gregorian calendars in September of 1752.
   Prior to 8AD, results may be incorrect.
   The calculation is by simple tabulation of the number of days in
   each month and year between the given date and 1/1/1960, through
   calls to the days_in_month and days_in_year functions.

   EXCEPTIONS 

   NOTE Calendar dates prior to 1920 were different in many countries.

   DESCRIPTION  Convert to ``julian'' days from month/weekday/index/year,

      IARG  index   index for nth wkday, 1-5 or -1 for last
      IARG  year    the year
      OARG  julian  the calculated day number 

   RETURN Returns 1/0 for success/failure.  The routine fails if the input 
   arguments do not correspond to a real date or if the pointer for the

   ALGORITHM This is a C function that calculates the day number given a

      IARG  year    the year to calculate it (e.g. 1978)
      OARG  julian  the calculated day number 

   RETURN Returns 1/0 for success/failure.  The algorithm fails if

   ALGORITHM This is a C function that calculates easter from
   an algorithm given in a web site called ``Whence Easter,'' at
   http://www.gold.net/{\mytilde}cdwf/misc/easter.html.  The
   given algorithm calculates the number of days since March 22nd
   for Easter, to which we add the ``julian'' day number for March
   22nd in that year, found with the julian_from_mdy function.
   The day number corresponds to the number of calendar days since 
   January 1, 1960 (which is defined to be day 0). The calendar follows 
   the conventions of the British Empire, which 
   changed from Julian to Gregorian calendars in September of 1752.

   DESCRIPTION  Convert from number of milliseconds to fraction of a day.

   ARGUMENTS
      IARG  ms     number of milliseconds
      OARG  frac   fraction of the day

   RETURN The return value is 1/0 for success/failure.  The routine
   fails if the pointer for return data is NULL or if the input
   number of milliseconds is negative or exceeds one day.

   ALGORITHM   This is a C function that converts between number of
   milliseconds to fraction of a day by simple division.

   EXCEPTIONS 

   NOTE The fraction of the day is always calculated with respect to
   a normal-length day, not taking into account leap seconds.  On a 
   day with a leap second, the fraction returned will be exactly 1
   for the entire last second of the day.
